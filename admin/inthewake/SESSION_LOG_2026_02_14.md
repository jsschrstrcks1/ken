## Decisions Made This Session

1. ✅ **Follow careful-not-clever guardrail strictly** — Reading critical docs first, documenting everything, verifying before moving forward
2. ✅ **Create comprehensive state document** — PROJECT_STATE_2026_02_14.md captures current reality in one place
3. ✅ **Update tracking files in real-time** — admin/IN_PROGRESS_TASKS.md updated as work progresses
4. ✅ **Document rationale, not just actions** — Explaining WHY things are intentional vs accidental

## Assumptions & Verifications

### Assumption 1: "Project is feature-complete for v3.010.305"
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED
- admin/UNFINISHED_TASKS.md shows 887 pending items, but marked as "P2-P4" (not critical path)
- P0 priorities all marked "COMPLETE" (CLAUDE.md l.710-716)
- Active thread (claude/onboard-and-audit-PvzvO) is documentation fixes, not feature blocking
- **Conclusion:** v3.010.305 is feature-complete; remaining work is maintenance/optimization

### Assumption 2: "ICP-Lite v1.4 is the current protocol"
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED
- CLAUDE.md v1.2.7 references "ICP-Lite v1.4" throughout (lines 423, 455, etc.)
- ONBOARDING.md v1.2.0 confirms "ICP-Lite v1.4 Requirement" (line 243)
- All meta tag examples use v1.4 format (dual-cap rule documented)
- **Conclusion:** v1.4 is current; v1.0 references in some docs are STALE

### Assumption 3: "Theological foundation is immutable"
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED
- ONBOARDING.md states "Immutable regardless of version" (l.236)
- CLAUDE.md states "Non-Negotiable" (l.85)
- skill-rules.json guardrails include "IMMUTABLE" (l.407)
- Every example includes Soli Deo Gloria invocation before line 20
- **Conclusion:** This is project DNA, not changeable

---

## Critical Fix #1: Accessibility (aria-hidden on Soli Deo Gloria) — COMPLETE ✅

**Issue:** 224 ship pages had aria-hidden="true" applied to Soli Deo Gloria paragraphs
**Root Cause:** Theological invocation was hidden from screen readers (accessibility violation)
**Solution:** Removed aria-hidden="true" attribute from all 224 affected pages
**Testing:**
- Pre-fix: 226 accessibility warnings in validation
- Post-fix: aria-hidden warnings eliminated
- Verified on sample ships (carnival-breeze, silver-spirit, seabourn-quest)
**Commit:** b9d2ca67 — FIX: Remove aria-hidden from Soli Deo Gloria (224 ship pages)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE, pushed to origin/claude/review-docs-codebase-IJvuW

## Critical Fix #2: Navigation (/planning.html link) — COMPLETE ✅

**Issue:** 302 ship pages missing `<a href="/planning.html">Planning</a>` link
**Root Cause:** RCL ships had the link; non-RCL ships missing (template sync issue)
**Solution:** Created Perl fix script, tested on 4 samples, batch applied to all 302
**Testing:**
- [x] Tested carnival-adventure, carnival-breeze, silver-spirit, grand-princess
- [x] Verified indentation & structure correct
- [x] All 302 files modified successfully
**Commit:** `ffed3834` — FIX: Add missing /planning.html link to navigation (302 ships)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE, pushed to origin/claude/review-docs-codebase-IJvuW

## Critical Fix #3: Generic Review Text — ANALYSIS COMPLETE (Deferred)

**Issue:** 208 ship pages flagged for generic/template JSON-LD review text
**Investigation:** Analyzed 207 ships with exact same template pattern
**Template Found:** "[Ship Name] from [Cruise Line] offers memorable cruise experiences with excellent amenities and service."
**Affected Ships:** 207 out of 315 (65.7%)
**Solution Complexity:** HIGH
- Requires unique editorial content for each ship
- Time estimate: 17-35 hours (5-10 min per ship × 207 ships)
- Exceeds reasonable scope for single session

**Recommendation:**
- Defer Phase 3 to next session
- Suggest phased approach: Tier 1 (RCL 50 ships) → Tier 2 (Norwegian 20, Carnival 48) → Tier 3 (others)
- Tier 1 estimate: 4-8 hours (manageable)

**Documentation:** Created PHASE_3_GENERIC_REVIEW_ANALYSIS_2026_02_14.md with full analysis and recommendations
**Status:** ✅ DEFERRED (awaiting user decision on priority)

---

## Session 3 Work (2026-02-15)

### Phase 4: Compass Rose Accessibility Fix
- **Issue:** 212 ships had decorative compass_rose.svg with `alt=""` but no `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Fix:** Node.js script added `aria-hidden="true"` to all 212 files (222 instances)
- **Testing:** Verified on 4 sample ships; cross-checked no double-adding on already-fixed files
- **Impact:** +96 ships passing (23 → 119)

### Phase 5: Noscript Logbook Fallback
- **Issue:** 56 ships with empty `#logbook-stories` div, no content for no-JS users
- **Fix:** Extracted first story from each ship's logbook JSON, inserted as `<noscript>` block
- **Manual:** 2 Celebrity ships (personas-based JSON) fixed by hand
- **Testing:** Verified rcl/voyager-of-the-seas went from FAIL (90) to PASS (100)
- **Impact:** +38 more ships passing (119 → 157)
