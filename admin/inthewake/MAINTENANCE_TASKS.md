## 1. Content Quality Maintenance

### 1.1 ICP-Lite Metadata Updates

**Frequency:** Weekly or after content edits

**What:** Ensure all pages have valid ICP-Lite v1.4 metadata.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Validate all pages
node admin/validate-icp-lite-v14.js --all

# Validate specific file
node admin/validate-icp-lite-v14.js ships/rcl/adventure-of-the-seas.html
```

**Checks:**
- `ai-summary` meta tag exists (max 250 chars, first 155 standalone)
- `last-reviewed` meta tag with valid date
- `content-protocol` set to "ICP-Lite v1.4"
- JSON-LD `description` mirrors `ai-summary` exactly
- JSON-LD `dateModified` mirrors `last-reviewed` exactly

**ICP-Lite Review Cadence (from protocol):**
| Page Type | Review Frequency |
|-----------|------------------|
| Tool pages (prices, calculators) | Weekly |
| Hub pages (ships.html, ports.html) | Monthly |
| Ship pages | Quarterly |
| Port pages | As-needed |
| New pages | On creation |

**Reference:** `.claude/skills/standards/resources/icp-lite-protocol.md`

---

### 1.2 Placeholder Content Check

**Frequency:** Weekly

**What:** Find and fill in "Unknown" placeholders.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check for Unknown placeholders (runs in CI)
grep -r --include="*.html" "Unknown" . | grep -v node_modules
```

**Common Patterns to Fix:**
- `Unknown ship`
- `Unknown photographer`
- `Photo by: Unknown`
- `Attribution: Unknown`

**Action:** Replace with actual information or remove if not applicable.

---

### 1.3 Content Length Validation

**Frequency:** Monthly

**What:** Ensure content sections meet minimum length requirements.

**Standards:**
| Content Type | Minimum |
|-------------|---------|
| FAQ sections | 200 words |
| Logbook stories | 300 words |
| Page static content | 500 words |
| Alt text | 20 characters |

**Command:**
```bash
node admin/validate-ship-page.js --all-ships 2>&1 | grep -E "(FAQ|story|content)"
```

---

### 1.4 Logbook Persona Coverage

**Frequency:** Monthly

**What:** Ensure ship pages have stories covering all required personas.

**Required Personas:**
- Solo traveler
- Multi-generational / family
- Honeymoon / couple
- Elderly / retiree
- Widow / grief
- Accessible / special needs

**Check:**
```bash
node admin/validate-ship-page.js --all-ships 2>&1 | grep "persona"
```

**Reference:** `admin/UNFINISHED_TASKS.md` for current status

---

### 1.5 Last-Reviewed Date Updates (CRITICAL)

**Frequency:** Every time a page is edited

**What:** Update the `last-reviewed` meta tag and matching JSON-LD `dateModified` whenever ANY change is made to a page.

**Why This Matters:**
- Google uses `dateModified` to assess content freshness
- AI systems use `last-reviewed` to determine information currency
- Stale dates signal outdated content to both humans and machines
- Fresh dates improve search ranking and AI trust

**Required Updates When Editing ANY Page:**
```html
<!-- Update the meta tag -->
<meta name="last-reviewed" content="2026-01-17"/>

<!-- Update the matching JSON-LD (MUST be identical) -->
"dateModified": "2026-01-17"
```

**Rule:** If you touch a page, update the date. No exceptions.

---

### 1.6 Stale Page Audit (6+ Months)

**Frequency:** Monthly

**What:** Identify pages that haven't been reviewed in 6+ months and prioritize them for updates.

**Why:** Pages with old `last-reviewed` dates:
- May contain outdated information
- Signal to Google/AI that content may be stale
- Risk losing search ranking over time
- May have broken links or missing images

**Command to Find Stale Pages:**
```bash
# Find pages with last-reviewed dates older than 6 months
# This searches for dates before the cutoff (adjust YYYY-MM as needed)
grep -r --include="*.html" 'name="last-reviewed"' . | \
  grep -E 'content="202[0-4]|content="2025-0[1-6]"' | \
  cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
```

**Alternative - Check by Directory:**
```bash
# Check ship pages
for f in ships/**/*.html; do
  DATE=$(grep -o 'last-reviewed" content="[^"]*' "$f" | cut -d'"' -f3)
  if [[ "$DATE" < "2025-07-01" ]]; then
    echo "STALE: $f ($DATE)"
  fi
done

# Check port pages
for f in ports/**/*.html; do
  DATE=$(grep -o 'last-reviewed" content="[^"]*' "$f" | cut -d'"' -f3)
  if [[ "$DATE" < "2025-07-01" ]]; then
    echo "STALE: $f ($DATE)"
  fi
done
```

**When Refreshing Stale Pages:**
1. Review content for accuracy
2. Update any outdated information
3. Fix broken links
4. Verify images still exist
5. Update `last-reviewed` and `dateModified` to today
6. Run page validator

**Priority Order for Stale Pages:**
1. High-traffic pages (popular ships, major ports)
2. Pages with oldest dates
3. Pages with known issues

---

### 1.7 Vanilla Stories Audit (MAJOR BACKLOG)

**Frequency:** Quarterly review, ongoing work

**What:** Replace generic template stories with authentic, ship-specific content.

**Current Status (updated 2026-02-13):**
- ~8 ships have ~20-24 vanilla/institutional-author stories remaining
- Cruise lines affected: Costa (4 ships), Explora (4 ships — mostly future/unbuilt)
- All other cruise lines verified 100% quality: RCL, Carnival, Celebrity, NCL, HAL, Princess, MSC, Oceania, Regent, Seabourn, Silversea, Virgin, Cunard

**Vanilla Story Characteristics (BAD):**
- Generic titles like "First Impressions of [Ship Name]"
- Template text that fits any ship
- "Community Contributor" as author
- 100-150 word count (too short)
- No ship-specific venues mentioned
- No emotional narrative

**Quality Story Characteristics (GOOD):**
- Specific ship venues mentioned
- Real author name with location
- Service recovery narrative (crisis → response → resolution)
- Emotional pivot / tearjerker moment
- Faith-scented references (natural, not forced)
- 300-600 word count
- Unique persona perspective

**Reference:** `admin/VANILLA-STORIES.md` for full inventory

**Priority Order (remaining):**
1. Costa (4 ships — Favolosa, Firenze, Fortuna, Pacifica)
2. Explora III-VI (4 future ships — lower priority, mostly unbuilt)

---

## 10. Ship Deployments Data Maintenance

### 10.1 Ship Deployments JSON Updates

**Frequency:** Bi-annually (Fall and Spring) or when cruise lines announce major deployment changes

**What:** Keep `assets/data/ship-deployments.json` current with ship homeport assignments and typical port calls.

**Data File:** `assets/data/ship-deployments.json`
**JS Module:** `assets/js/ship-port-links.js`

**Current Coverage (as of 2026-01-29):**

- 371 ports with cross-links
- 15 of 15 cruise lines implemented

**When to Update:**
1. **Cruise line announces new ship deployments** (typically October for next year)
2. **New ships enter service** (add to ships object and port_to_ships)
3. **Ship changes homeport** (update homeports array, typical_ports, homeport_details)
4. **Seasonal repositioning** (spring/fall schedule changes)
5. **Ship leaves fleet** (retirements, transfers to other cruise lines)

**Data Sources:**
- Royal Caribbean: [royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships)
- Carnival: [carnival.com/cruise-ships](https://www.carnival.com/cruise-ships)
- CruiseMapper: [cruisemapper.com](https://www.cruisemapper.com) (deployment schedules)
- Cruise line press releases
- Ship page `ai-summary` metadata (contains homeport info)

**How to Update:**

1. **Add a new ship:**
   ```json
   "new-ship-slug": {
     "name": "Ship Name",
     "class": "Class Name",
     "cruise_line": "rcl|carnival|celebrity|etc",
     "homeports": ["port-slug"],
     "regions": ["region-name"],
     "season": "year-round|seasonal|summer|winter",
     "typical_ports": ["port1", "port2"],
     "itinerary_lengths": [4, 7]
   }
   ```

2. **Update port_to_ships:** Add ship slug to each port it visits
   ```json
   "cozumel": ["existing-ships", "new-ship-slug"]
   ```

3. **Update homeport_details:** If new homeport or adding ships to existing homeport
   ```json
   "new-homeport": {
     "name": "Display Name",
     "state": "State/Province",
     "country": "Country",
     "ships": ["ship-slug"],
     "port_page": "/ports/port-slug.html"
   }
   ```

**Validation:**
```bash
# Validate JSON syntax
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('assets/data/ship-deployments.json')); print('Valid')"

# Count ships by cruise line
python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('assets/data/ship-deployments.json')); print({cl: len([s for s in d['ships'].values() if s.get('cruise_line')==cl]) for cl in ['rcl','carnival']})"
```

### 10.2 Adding New Cruise Lines

**Frequency:** As resources allow (see admin/UNFINISHED_TASKS.md for priority list)

**Remaining Cruise Lines (0):**
All 15 cruise lines have been implemented. Disney is excluded per user preference.

**Steps to Add a New Cruise Line:**

1. **Update CRUISE_LINES in ship-port-links.js:**
   ```javascript
   'celebrity': {
     name: 'Celebrity Cruises',
     path: '/ships/celebrity/',
     bookingUrl: 'https://www.celebritycruises.com/cruise-ships/',
     allShipsUrl: '/ships.html'
   }
   ```

2. **Add class order for sorting (larger ships first):**
   ```javascript
   'celebrity': ['Edge', 'Millennium', 'Solstice', 'Other']
   ```

3. **Add brand colors:**
   ```javascript
   'celebrity': { bg: '#f5f0eb', border: '#d4c4b0', hover: '#ebe3d9', text: '#1a1a1a' }
   ```

4. **Gather deployment data** from cruise line website and add ships to JSON

5. **Update port_to_ships** for all ports the new cruise line visits

6. **Add homeport_details** for any new homeports

7. **Update UNFINISHED-TASKS.md** to track progress

**Reference:** See git commit `a2fafad4` for example of adding Carnival cruise line

---

### 10.3 Seasonal Deployment Monitoring

**Frequency:** Twice yearly (April and October)

**What:** Cruise lines typically announce seasonal changes:

- [ ] Ships leaving for drydock or refit
- [ ] New ships entering service

**Typical Seasonal Patterns:**
- **Winter:** Caribbean, Mexico, Australia
- **Summer:** Alaska, Europe, Canada/New England
- **Year-round:** Caribbean hubs (Miami, Port Canaveral, Galveston)

---

### 10.4 Port Name Formatting

**Frequency:** When adding new ports

**What:** Ensure special port names are properly formatted in `ship-port-links.js`.

**Location:** `formatPortName()` function in `assets/js/ship-port-links.js`

**Add entries for ports with special formatting:**
```javascript
const specialNames = {
  'half-moon-cay': 'Half Moon Cay',
  'grand-turk': 'Grand Turk',
  'st-thomas': 'St. Thomas',
  // Add new ports here
};
```

**Note:** Ports not in this list will be auto-formatted from slug (e.g., "cozumel" → "Cozumel")
