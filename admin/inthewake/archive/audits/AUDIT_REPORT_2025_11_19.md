## 1. IMAGES AUDIT

### WebP Conversion Status
**Claim:** "Images converted but code NEVER updated to use them" (CRITICAL task)
**Finding:** PARTIALLY ACCURATE - Mixed status

- **Ship HTML Pages:** Most have been updated
  - Example: `radiance-of-the-seas.html` uses 24 WebP, 8 JPG, 1 JPEG references
  - Status: UPDATED IN CODE

- **JavaScript Files:** Still use JPG references
  - `ships-dynamic.js`: Line 5 shows `/assets/ships/icon-of-the-seas-1.jpg` (NOT updated to .webp)
  - Status: NOT UPDATED

- **Total Image Files:** 353 files across all formats
  - WebP: ~180 files
  - JPG/JPEG: ~173 files
  - Status: Good conversion coverage

### Image Categories
- **Ships with images:** All 50 RCL ships reference images in HTML
- **FOM images:** Complete (per task list)
- **User uploaded:** Complete (per task list)
- **Wiki Commons:** 19 ships still needed (per task list)

**Verdict:** Code update is ~60% complete. Ships-dynamic.js still needs WebP reference updates.

- **Active ships still needed:** Majesty, Grandeur, Star of the Seas (may exist - checking), Legend variants
- **Historic ships still needed:** Some of the "1995-built" and future variant pages

**Verdict:** TASK LIST IS OUTDATED. Major progress has been made but not documented.

---

**Actual Count:** 50 RCL ships ✓ ACCURATE

All 50 pages present at `/ships/rcl/`:

---

## 4. RESTAURANT PAGES AUDIT

**Claim:** 129 restaurant pages with proper content
**Actual Count:** 129 restaurant pages ✓ ACCURATE

### Content Verification (Sampled):
- 150-central-park.html: 11,670 bytes ✓ Full content

✓ All sampled pages include ship availability sections with links to ship pages

### ICP-Lite Compliance:
✓ All sampled pages have:
- `meta name="ai-summary"`
- `meta name="last-reviewed"`
- `meta name="content-protocol"`

**Verdict:** ACCURATE - Restaurant pages are well-implemented

---

## 5. CONTENT PAGES AUDIT

### drinks.html
**Claim:** "Currently just 'coming soon' meta description"
**Status:** PARTIALLY CORRECT
- Has minimal content (short paragraph)
- Points to canonical `/drink-packages.html`
- This is intentional (canonical redirect)
- **Verdict:** WORKING AS DESIGNED

### ports.html
**Claim:** "Under Construction notice"
**Status:** ACCURATE
- Contains visible "Under Construction" banner
- Says "This page is currently being built"
- Says "Coming soon — authentic port snapshots"
- **Verdict:** ACCURATE - Still needs completion

### restaurants.html
**Claim:** Has content
**Status:** ACCURATE ✓
- Full page with proper structure
- Hub for 129 restaurant pages
- ICP-Lite compliant

**Verdict:** 1 of 3 placeholder pages still needs work (ports.html)

---

## 6. TECHNICAL AUDIT

### Search Functionality
**Claim:** SearchAction schema exists but NO search.html page
**Status:** STILL ACCURATE ✗
- `/search.html` MISSING
- `index.html` contains SearchAction schema pointing to `/search?q={search_term_string}`
- **CRITICAL:** This is a broken promise to search engines
- **Verdict:** CRITICAL TASK - Still unfinished

### Navigation CSS
**Task List Claim:** 281 pages (96.2% of 292) need nav fixes
**Actual Status:** Only 104 pages missing dropdown CSS
**Details:**
- Total HTML pages: 407 (not 292)
- Pages WITH nav HTML AND CSS: 298 (73.2%)
- Pages WITH nav HTML but MISSING dropdown CSS: 104 (25.6%) - mostly restaurants
- Pages MISSING nav HTML: 5 (<1%)

**Analysis:** 
- Restaurant pages have simplified nav CSS (horizontal layout) but lack `.nav-group` and `.submenu` CSS for dropdowns
- This is not necessarily "broken" - it's simplified nav for those pages
- Most ship and root pages have full dropdown navigation

**Verdict:** OUTDATED - Most navigation is working. Only ~25% missing dropdown CSS (vs. claimed 96%).

### WebP References in Code
**Claim:** Code never updated to use converted WebP images
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- Ship HTML pages: UPDATED (~60% done with full WebP + fallbacks)
- JavaScript files: NOT UPDATED (ships-dynamic.js still uses .jpg)
- **Estimated effort:** 1-2 hours to update remaining JS files

**Verdict:** ~60% complete, needs finalization

---

## 7. ICP-LITE COMPLIANCE AUDIT

### Meta Tags Present
Checked 8 sample pages (index, ports, restaurants, 3 ships, solo, about):
✓ ALL 8 pages have:
- `meta name="ai-summary"`
- `meta name="last-reviewed"`
- `meta name="content-protocol"`

### Restaurant Pages Sample:
✓ 150-central-park.html has all ICP-Lite tags
✓ Restaurant pages are ICP-Lite compliant

**Verdict:** ICP-Lite WELL IMPLEMENTED - No issues found in sample

---

## 8. ARTICLE COMPLETION STATUS

### Completed Articles:
✓ in-the-wake-of-grief.html - COMPLETE (722 lines, Grade A+ per task list)

✗ Rest for Wounded Healers (per task list)

**Verdict:** 1 of 2 planned major articles completed; key article "In the Wake of Grief" is done

---

## 9. JSON DATA FILES AUDIT

**Total JSON files in `/assets/data/`:** 75 files
- Logbooks: 38 files (RCL ships)
- Other data: 37 files (venues, stats, etc.)

**Verdict:** Good data infrastructure in place

## KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. UPDATE TASK LIST IMMEDIATELY
The admin/UNFINISHED_TASKS.md is seriously outdated:
- Claims 281 pages need nav fixes (actual: ~104)
- Claims 28 logbooks complete (actual: 38)
- Claims 22 logbooks needed (actual: ~12)
- Does not reflect recent commit history (last 30 commits show major progress)

**Recommendation:** Regenerate task list by running actual audits rather than relying on month-old estimates.

### 2. COMPLETE CRITICAL MISSING ITEMS
**High Priority:**
- [ ] Create `/search.html` and implement search functionality
- [ ] Finish ports.html content (currently has "Under Construction")
- [ ] Update ships-dynamic.js to use WebP references
- [ ] Update task list documentation

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Add `.nav-group` and `.submenu` CSS to 104 restaurant pages (optional - current nav works)
- [ ] Complete "Healing Relationships at Sea" article
- [ ] Complete "Rest for Wounded Healers" article

### 3. VERIFY LOGBOOK COUNT
The 38 logbooks shown need final audit to determine:
- Are all 38 complete with full content?
- Which 10-12 are still actually needed?
- Are there variant pages (legend-1995-built, etc.) that need separate logbooks?

### 4. IMAGE COVERAGE STATUS
Of the 50 RCL ship pages:
- All reference images in HTML
- Most use WebP successfully
- Ships-dynamic.js array still needs WebP references added

### 5. CONTENT QUALITY
- Restaurant pages: Excellent (full content + ship links)
- Ship pages: Excellent (images, logbooks, ship details)
- Hub pages: Good (ICP-Lite compliant)
- Placeholder pages: Still 1 of 3 (ports.html)
