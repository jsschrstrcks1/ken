# Ship Page Validation Audit & Path to 100%

**Project:** In the Wake (cruisinginthewake.com)
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Branch:** `claude/validate-ship-pages-5Z2jp`
**Validator:** ITW-SHIP-002 v2.2
**Audited By:** Claude AI

---

## Executive Summary

The ship page validator currently reports **154 passing / 160 failing** out of 314 total entries (**49% pass rate**). However, 16 of those failures are **fleet index pages** (`index.html`) and 5 are **non-ship utility pages** (template, rooms, quiz, allshipquiz, venues). These are not ship detail pages and should not be scored by the ship validator.

**Adjusted numbers (true ship pages only):**

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| True ship pages | 293 |
| Currently passing | 154 |
| Currently failing | 139 |
| **Effective pass rate** | **52.6%** |

The path to 100% requires addressing **5 distinct failure tiers**, from quick template fixes affecting 60+ pages each to individual page-specific content issues.

## Top 10 Failure Codes

| Rank | Count | Code | Severity | Description |
|------|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | 300 | `navigation/some_missing_nav` | Warning | Missing `/ships/quiz.html` or `/planning.html` nav link |
| 2 | 269 | `logbook/short_stories` | Warning | Stories under 300 words |
| 3 | 265 | `word_counts/low_static_content` | Warning | Static content under target word count |
| 4 | 259 | `viewport/grid_responsive` | Warning | Grid-2 sections need responsive CSS check |
| 5 | 205 | `sections/missing_whimsical_units` | Warning | Missing `#whimsical-units-container` |
| 6 | 204 | `word_counts/faq_too_short` | Warning | FAQ section under 200 words |
| 7 | 161 | `sections/missing_grid2_firstlook_dining` | Warning | First Look + Dining not in grid-2 pair |
| 8 | 145 | `images/few_images` | **Error** | Fewer than 8 images |
| 9 | 110 | `discoverability/in_atlas_not_ready` | Warning | In atlas but under 90% score |
| 10 | 86 | `videos/missing_categories` | **Error** | Missing required video categories |

**Key insight:** Only 3 of the top 10 issues are blocking errors. The majority are warnings. The actual blocking errors cluster into a small number of fixable categories.

---

## Blocking Error Analysis

Every failing ship page has at least one of these blocking error types:

### Error Type A: Missing/Few Videos (affects ~120 pages)
```
[videos/few_videos] Only 0 videos, minimum 10
[videos/missing_categories] Missing video categories: ship walk through, top ten, suite, balcony, oceanview, interior, food, accessible
```
**Root cause:** Non-RCL cruise lines have no video JSON manifests. The validator requires 10+ videos across 8 categories.
**Fix complexity:** HIGH — requires YouTube video research per ship, creating video JSON files.
**Scope:** All Silversea, Seabourn, Regent, Oceania, Cunard, Costa, Virgin Voyages, Explora ships; most MSC and Celebrity ships.

### Error Type B: Few Images (affects ~145 pages)
```
[images/few_images] Only 6 images, minimum 8
```
**Root cause:** Many non-RCL pages were created with a minimal template containing 5-6 images.
**Fix complexity:** MEDIUM — requires sourcing 2-3 additional locally-hosted images per page.
**Scope:** Nearly all failing pages across all non-RCL cruise lines.

### Error Type C: Section Order Issues (affects ~40 pages)
```
[sections/wrong_section_order] Sections out of expected order: dining
```
**Root cause:** Dining section not placed after First Look in the expected order.
**Fix complexity:** LOW — HTML section reorder, scriptable.
**Scope:** Cunard, some MSC, some Celebrity, some Holland America.

### Error Type D: Missing Local Images (affects ~5 RCL pages)
```
[images/missing_local_images] 8 image(s) referenced but not found locally
```
**Root cause:** HTML references `/assets/ships/` images that don't exist on disk.
**Fix complexity:** LOW — either create placeholder images or update references.
**Scope:** Symphony of the Seas, Serenade of the Seas, possibly others.

### Error Type E: TBN/Unnamed Template Issues (affects ~14 pages)
```
[consistency/wrong_ship_video] Video heading references "Radiance" but page is for "Icon Class Ship Tbn 2027"
[json_ld/wrong_class_reference] Review references "radiance-class" but ship is not radiance class
[logbook/few_stories] Only 2 stories, minimum 10
```
**Root cause:** TBN pages were cloned from Radiance template without updating ship-specific references.
**Fix complexity:** MEDIUM — template cleanup + minimal content generation.
**Scope:** RCL TBN pages, Carnival unnamed-project-ace pages, Celebrity unnamed pages.

### Error Type F: Carnival Historic Ship Issues (affects ~8 pages)
```
[ai_breadcrumbs/missing_siblings] Missing required field: siblings
[ai_breadcrumbs/invalid_date] Updated date malformed
[sections/missing_required] Missing required sections: page_intro, first_look, faq
```
**Root cause:** Carnival historic ships use a different template than RCL historic ships.
**Fix complexity:** MEDIUM — needs ai-breadcrumbs fixes and section additions.
**Scope:** tropicale-1981, mardi-gras-1972, jubilee-1986, holiday-1985, festivale-1961, celebration-1987, carnivale-1956.

### Error Type G: One-Off Page Issues (affects ~5 pages)
Various unique issues:
- `msc-world-america.html`: hotlinked images, unclosed section tags, swiper missing rewind
- `carnival-tropicale.html`: 12 errors (severely broken page)
- `carnival-adventure.html`: 7 errors (stub page)
- `carnival-mardi-gras.html` (the 1972 original): naming collision issues
- `legend-of-the-seas-1995-built.html`: 9 errors (needs major rework)

## Path to 100%: Five-Tier Fix Plan

### Tier 0: Validator Scope Fix (Immediate — 21 pages removed from failure count)
**Impact: 160 failures → 139 failures**

Exclude non-ship pages from the ship validator's `--all-ships` sweep:

| Page Type | Count | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Fleet index pages (`*/index.html`) | 16 | Exclude from ship validator or create fleet-index validator |
| Root utility pages (`template.html`, `rooms.html`, `quiz.html`, `allshipquiz.html`) | 4 | Exclude from ship validator |
| `rcl/venues.html` | 1 | Exclude from ship validator |

**Implementation:** Update `validate-ship-page.js` glob pattern to exclude `index.html` and known non-ship files. Alternatively, add a `<!-- page-type: fleet-index -->` marker and skip those.

---

### Tier 1: Quick Wins — Near-Pass Pages (2 pages → passing)
**Impact: 139 → 137 failures**

These pages need only 1-2 targeted fixes:

| Page | Score | Errors | Fix Needed |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| `rcl/symphony-of-the-seas.html` | 80 | 1E | Add missing local image files to `/assets/ships/` |
| `rcl/serenade-of-the-seas.html` | 80 | 1E | Add missing local image files to `/assets/ships/` |
| `princess/grand-princess.html` | 74 | 1E | Likely image or video issue — verify and fix |
| `princess/emerald-princess.html` | 76 | 1E | Likely image or video issue — verify and fix |
| `carnival/carnival-encounter.html` | 64 | 2E | Add video JSON manifest (only blocking errors are video-related) |

---

### Tier 2: Template-Level Fixes for Non-RCL Lines (97 pages)
**Impact: 137 → ~40 failures**

The vast majority of non-RCL failures share identical error profiles. They were built from a common template missing these elements:

**Common 3-Error Profile (score ~54):** images/few_images + videos/few_videos + videos/missing_categories
**Common 4-Error Profile (score ~44):** Above + sections/wrong_section_order

**Fix strategy per cruise line:**

| Cruise Line | Ships Failing | Primary Errors | Batch Fix |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| MSC | 23 | 3E (images + videos) | Create video manifests, add 2-3 images per page |
| Celebrity | 17 | 3-5E (images + videos + section order) | Fix section order, add images, create video manifests |
| Silversea | 12 | 3E (images + videos) | Create video manifests, add 2 images per page |
| Costa | 9 | 4E (images + videos + order) | Fix section order, add images, create video manifests |
| Oceania | 8 | 3-4E (images + videos) | Create video manifests, add 2 images per page |
| Holland America (active) | 8 | 4E (images + videos + order) | Fix section order, add images, create video manifests |
| Seabourn | 7 | 3-4E (images + videos) | Create video manifests, add 2 images per page |
| Regent | 7 | 3E (images + videos) | Create video manifests, add 2 images per page |
| Explora Journeys | 6 | 3-4E (images + videos) | Create video manifests, add 2 images per page |
| Cunard | 4 | 4E (images + videos + order) | Fix section order, add images, create video manifests |
| Virgin Voyages | 4 | 3-5E (images + videos) | Create video manifests, add images |
| Explora (legacy) | 2 | 3E (images + videos) | Create video manifests, add images |

**Required deliverables:**
1. **Video JSON manifests** for each cruise line (YouTube research needed)
2. **2-3 additional locally-hosted images** per failing ship page
3. **Section order fixes** for ~40 pages with wrong dining placement

**Recommended approach:** Build batch scripts per cruise line, similar to the existing `batch-fix-carnival-ships.js` pattern.

---

### Tier 3: TBN / Future Ship Pages (14 pages)
**Impact: ~40 → ~26 failures**

| Cruise Line | Pages | Issues |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| RCL | `icon-class-ship-tbn-2027.html`, `icon-class-ship-tbn-2028.html`, `star-class-ship-tbn-2028.html`, `quantum-ultra-class-ship-tbn-2028.html`, `quantum-ultra-class-ship-tbn-2029.html`, `discovery-class-ship-tbn.html`, `oasis-class-ship-tbn-2028.html`, `legend-of-the-seas-icon-class-entering-service-in-2026.html` | Wrong class references (cloned from Radiance template), few stories, missing videos |
| Carnival | `unnamed-project-ace-1.html`, `unnamed-project-ace-2.html`, `unnamed-project-ace-3.html` | Template stub, few images, missing content |
| Celebrity | `unnamed-river-class-x6.html`, `unnamed-project-nirvana.html`, `unnamed-edge-class.html` | Template stub, 9 errors each |

**Fix strategy:**
- Remove Radiance-class template references, replace with correct class
- Add placeholder logbook stories (generic class-anticipation stories)
- For Celebrity unnamed ships: rebuild from correct template
- Consider whether TBN pages with no real ship data should pass validation at all (validator policy decision)

---

### Tier 4: Carnival Historic Ships (8 pages)
**Impact: ~26 → ~18 failures**

| Page | Score | Primary Issues |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `tropicale-1981.html` | 38 | Missing siblings, malformed date, missing sections |
| `mardi-gras-1972.html` | 38 | Same pattern |
| `jubilee-1986.html` | 38 | Same pattern |
| `holiday-1985.html` | 38 | Same pattern |
| `festivale-1961.html` | 38 | Same pattern |
| `celebration-1987.html` | 38 | Same pattern |
| `carnivale-1956.html` | 28 | Same + extra issues |
| `carnival-festivale.html` | 34 | TBN variant of festivale |

**Fix strategy:**
1. Fix `ai-breadcrumbs` — add `siblings` field, fix malformed `updated` date format
2. Add missing required sections (`page_intro`, `first_look`, `faq`)
3. Follow the pattern established by passing RCL historic ships (Monarch, Nordic Empress, Majesty)

---

### Tier 5: One-Off / Severely Broken Pages (5-8 pages)
**Impact: ~18 → 0 failures**

| Page | Score | Errors | Action |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `msc/msc-world-america.html` | 4 | 8E | Fix hotlinked images, close section tags, add rewind:false, expand content |
| `carnival/carnival-tropicale.html` | 0 | 12E | Rebuild or merge with tropicale-1981.html |
| `carnival/carnival-adventure.html` | 8 | 7E | Stub page needs full build-out |
| `carnival/mardi-gras.html` | 32 | 5E | Disambiguate from mardi-gras-1972 |
| `rcl/legend-of-the-seas-1995-built.html` | 0 | 9E | Rebuild — likely needs merge with legend-of-the-seas.html |
| `rcl/legend-of-the-seas.html` | 42 | 4E | Section order + images + videos |
| `celebrity/ss-meridian.html` | 36 | 5E | Historic ship template fixes |
| `holland-america/none-announced.html` | 52 | 3E | Placeholder page — consider removing |

---

## Priority-Ordered Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundations (no content changes needed)
1. **Update validator to exclude non-ship pages** — Remove 21 false failures
2. **Fix section ordering** across ~40 pages — Scriptable batch fix
3. **Fix ai-breadcrumbs formatting** on Carnival historic pages — Scriptable

### Phase 2: Image Gaps
4. **Add missing local images** for RCL near-pass pages (Symphony, Serenade)
5. **Source and add 2-3 images** per non-RCL ship page (~120 pages)

### Phase 3: Video Manifests (highest effort)
6. **Create video JSON manifests** for each cruise line:
   - Research YouTube channels for each cruise line
   - Map videos to the 8 required categories per ship
   - Priority order: MSC (23 pages), Celebrity (17), Silversea (12), Costa (9)

### Phase 4: Content & Template Fixes
7. **Fix TBN/unnamed page templates** — Remove wrong class references
8. **Rebuild Carnival historic pages** to match RCL historic template
9. **Fix one-off broken pages** individually

### Phase 5: Warning Cleanup (not blocking, but improves scores)
10. **Add `/ships/quiz.html` nav link** to all pages (300 warnings)
11. **Expand logbook stories** to 300+ words (269 warnings)
12. **Add `#whimsical-units-container`** to non-RCL pages (205 warnings)
13. **Expand FAQ sections** to 200+ words (204 warnings)
14. **Add grid-2 First Look + Dining pairing** (161 warnings)

---

## Effort Estimates by Phase

| Phase | Pages Affected | Scriptable? | Blocking? |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Phase 1: Foundations | 21 + 40 | Yes | Removes 21 false failures + fixes ~40 section orders |
| Phase 2: Images | ~125 | Partially | Fixes blocking error on ~125 pages |
| Phase 3: Videos | ~120 | No (research) | Fixes blocking error on ~120 pages |
| Phase 4: Templates | ~27 | Partially | Fixes remaining broken pages |
| Phase 5: Warnings | ~300 | Yes (batch) | Non-blocking score improvements |

## Decision Points for Project Owner

### D1: Should TBN/unnamed ships be required to pass validation?
- **Option A:** Exempt TBN/future ships from full validation (reduces scope by ~14 pages)
- **Option B:** Require TBN ships to pass with placeholder content
- **Recommendation:** Option A — these ships don't exist yet; relaxed criteria make sense

**DECISION (2026-01-31): OPTION A — Exempt until ships are released.**

TBN/unnamed ships are exempt from full validation until they enter service. Once a ship is delivered and sailing, its page must pass full validation. See **Appendix C: TBN Ship Release Date Research** below for researched delivery dates and exemption expiry schedule.

### D2: Should the video requirement apply to all cruise lines?
- **Option A:** Require 10+ videos across 8 categories for all lines (current behavior)
- **Option B:** Reduce video requirements for luxury/expedition lines (smaller ships = fewer videos available)
- **Option C:** Make videos a warning instead of a blocking error for non-RCL lines
- **Recommendation:** Option C — videos are the single largest blocker and most effort-intensive fix. Making them warnings would immediately pass ~60 pages.

**DECISION (2026-01-31): NO POLICY CHANGE — Videos remain a blocking error. They will need to be researched.**

The video requirement stays as-is (Option A). Each cruise line's ships will need actual YouTube video research to create video JSON manifests. This is the most labor-intensive fix in the audit but is required for quality. No shortcuts — the videos must be real, categorized, and verified.

**TBN EXEMPTION (2026-01-31):** TBN/unnamed ships are exempt from video requirements under the same terms as D1. Video validation errors are downgraded to warnings for TBN ships until they enter service. Once a ship is delivered and sailing, it must have a complete video manifest passing full validation. See **Appendix C** for exemption expiry dates.

### D3: What to do with duplicate/legacy pages?
- `ships/explora/` vs `ships/explora-journeys/` (duplicate directory)
- `carnival-tropicale.html` vs `tropicale-1981.html` (same ship?)
- `legend-of-the-seas.html` vs `legend-of-the-seas-1995-built.html` vs `legend-of-the-seas-icon-class-entering-service-in-2026.html`
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate duplicates, redirect old URLs

**DECISION (2026-01-31): DOCUMENT AND DEFER — Will be discussed later.**

Full duplicate/legacy page analysis has been completed and documented in **Appendix D: Duplicate & Legacy Page Analysis** below. No action taken yet — consolidation strategy to be decided in a future session.

### D4: Should index pages have their own validator?
- Currently scoring 0/100 on the ship validator (wrong validator type)
- **Recommendation:** Create `validate-fleet-index.js` or exclude from ship validation

**DECISION (2026-01-31): YES — Create a fleet-index validator.**

Index pages will get their own dedicated validator (`validate-fleet-index.js`). They should be excluded from the ship page validator's `--all-ships` sweep immediately, and a purpose-built fleet-index validator should be created to check fleet index pages against appropriate criteria (cruise line branding, ship listing completeness, navigation links, etc.).

## Appendix D: Duplicate & Legacy Page Analysis

*Researched 2026-01-31. Deferred for owner discussion per Decision D3.*

### Confirmed Duplicates (Same Ship, Multiple Pages)

#### 1. `ships/explora/` vs `ships/explora-journeys/` — Legacy Directory

| Legacy (ships/explora/) | Current (ships/explora-journeys/) | Ship |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|------|
| `explora-i.html` (33K) | `explora-i.html` (29K) | Explora I |
| `explora-ii.html` (30K) | `explora-ii.html` (29K) | Explora II |
| `index.html` (7.3K) | `index.html` | Fleet index |

**Finding:** `ships/explora/` is the legacy directory. The `ships/explora-journeys/` directory is authoritative with 6 ships (I-VI) and proper sibling cross-linking. The legacy directory only knows about 2 ships.

**Recommended action (deferred):** Remove `ships/explora/` and redirect to `ships/explora-journeys/`.

#### 2. `ships/rcl/legend-of-the-seas.html` vs `ships/rcl/legend-of-the-seas-1995-built.html`

| File | Size | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| `legend-of-the-seas.html` (55K) | Current operational page | Voyager Class, 1995, currently in service |
| `legend-of-the-seas-1995-built.html` (52K) | Near-duplicate | Same ship, similar content |

**Finding:** Both cover the same 1995 Voyager Class ship. Content has diverged slightly (55K vs 52K). Neither is clearly the "canonical" version.

**Note:** The *new* Legend of the Seas (Icon Class, 2026) is a separate ship at `legend-of-the-seas-icon-class-entering-service-in-2026.html` — that one is NOT a duplicate.

**Recommended action (deferred):** Consolidate into one page, redirect the other.

#### 3. `ships/carnival/mardi-gras.html` vs `ships/carnival/carnival-mardi-gras.html`

| File | Size | Content |
|------|------|---------|
| `carnival-mardi-gras.html` (52K) | More complete | Current Excel-class Mardi Gras (2021) |
| `mardi-gras.html` (28K) | Less complete | Appears to be same Excel-class ship |

**Finding:** Both appear to cover the same current Excel-class ship (launched 2021). The `carnival-mardi-gras.html` version is more complete. Note: `mardi-gras-1972.html` is a *separate* historic ship (Carnival's founding vessel) — NOT a duplicate.

**Recommended action (deferred):** Consolidate into `carnival-mardi-gras.html`, redirect `mardi-gras.html`.

### NOT Duplicates (Ship Name Reuse Across Generations)

These pairs look like duplicates by name but are intentionally separate pages for different-era ships:

| Modern Ship | Historic Ship | Same Ship? |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| `carnival-tropicale.html` (Excel-class, 2028 future) | `tropicale-1981.html` (TSS Tropicale, scrapped 2021) | **No** — 45+ years apart |
| `carnival-celebration.html` (Excel-class, 2022) | `celebration-1987.html` (Holiday Class, scrapped 2021) | **No** — 35+ years apart |
| `carnival-festivale.html` (Excel-class, 2027 future) | `festivale-1961.html` (converted liner, scrapped 2003) | **No** — 60+ years apart |
| `carnival-jubilee.html` (Excel-class, 2023) | `jubilee-1986.html` (Holiday Class, scrapped 2017) | **No** — 37+ years apart |

**Naming convention confirmed:** `carnival-[name].html` = modern/active ship; `[name]-[year].html` = historic ship.

### Total Duplicate Count

| Category | Pages | Action Status |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Confirmed duplicates | 5 pages (2 Explora legacy + Explora legacy index + 1 Legend + 1 Mardi Gras) | Deferred |
| Not duplicates (name reuse) | 8 pages (4 pairs) | No action needed |

## Appendix E: Decision Summary

| Decision | Question | Answer | Date | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|------|--------|
| D1 | TBN/unnamed ship validation | **Exempt until ship enters service** | 2026-01-31 | Removes ~14 pages from failure denominator; re-add as ships launch |
| D2 | Video requirement policy | **No change — videos must be researched** | 2026-01-31 | Videos remain blocking errors; YouTube research required per cruise line |
| D3 | Duplicate/legacy pages | **Document and defer** | 2026-01-31 | 5 confirmed duplicate pages identified; consolidation strategy TBD |
| D4 | Fleet index validator | **Yes — create dedicated validator** | 2026-01-31 | Exclude 16 index pages from ship validator; build `validate-fleet-index.js` |

### Revised Quick Wins With Decisions Applied

With D1 (exempt TBN) and D4 (exclude index) adopted, but D2 unchanged (videos stay blocking):

| Action | Pages Fixed | New Pass Rate |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Exclude index + utility pages | Removes 21 from denominator | 154/293 = 52.6% |
| Exempt TBN/unnamed pages | Removes ~14 from denominator | 154/279 = 55.2% |
| Exempt questionable pages (Star Class, Quantum Ultra TBN) | Removes ~3 more | 154/276 = 55.8% |
| Fix section order (scriptable) | ~40 pages pass | ~194/276 = 70.3% |
| Add images to pages below threshold | ~30 more pages pass | ~224/276 = 81.2% |
| Research & create video manifests | ~50 more pages pass | ~274/276 = 99.3% |
| Fix remaining one-offs | ~2 more pages pass | **276/276 = 100%** |
