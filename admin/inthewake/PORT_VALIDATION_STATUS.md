# Port Validation Status

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for port page validation and repair status.
**Validator:** `admin/validate-port-page-v2.js` (authoritative — all sub-validators consolidated)
**Created:** 2026-04-09

## Validator Architecture (as of 2026-04-09)

v2 is the single authoritative port validator. It runs internally and orchestrates 5 sub-validators:

| Sub-Validator | What It Checks | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Internal (65+ checks) | ICP-2, sections, word counts, images, logbook, voice, rubric, purity, basic HTML, tender port, img existence | BLOCKING/WARNING |
| `validate-port-weather.js` v2.0 | Weather component: seasons, activities, hazards, FAQ, duplicates, port registry | BLOCKING |
| `validate-poi-coordinates.js` | POI lat/lon land-vs-water via Nominatim | BLOCKING |
| `validate-mobile-readiness.js` | Viewport, touch targets, overflow, font sizes (MOB-001–008) | BLOCKING |
| `validate-recent-articles.js` | Recent Rail pattern, pagination, JS implementation | BLOCKING |

**Run single port:** `node admin/validate-port-page-v2.js ports/<slug>.html`
**Run all ports:** `node scripts/batch-validate.js` (or `node admin/validate-port-page-v2.js --all-ports`)
**JSON output:** `node scripts/batch-validate.js --json`

## Baseline Status

**Last full batch run:** Pending (validator consolidated 2026-04-09 — run `batch-validate.js` for fresh numbers)

**Previous baselines (for reference, pre-consolidation):**

| Date | Validator | Pass Rate | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 2026-03-26 | v2 strict mode | 40/387 (10.3%) | Strict report — all checks enforced |
| 2026-03-25 | v2 + normalization | — | Phase 1 complete (63/68 Tier 1 section reordering) |
| 2026-03-02 | v2 (Session 12) | 242/387 (62.5%) | Template filler detection added |
| 2026-02-14 | v2 (Session 11) | 267/380 (70.3%) | Pre-normalization |

## Current Session Repairs (2026-04-09)

Ports validated with consolidated v2 + truth-checked via external LLM (Perplexity/You.com).

Fixed region Pacific→South Australia. Fixed data-port-name "Adelaide Port Guide"→"Adelaide". Rewrote all 5 template-filler weather FAQs with real Adelaide-specific answers. Summer temp claim corrected (avg 26-29°C, not "regularly exceed 40°C"). |
| agadir | 68 | 88 PASS | — | You.com (86%) | Country field "Atlas Mountain foothills"→"Morocco". Fixed data-port-name template artifact. Replaced generic weather hazard with real Agadir hazards (Saharan heat waves, marine fog). Rewrote all 5 template-filler weather FAQs. Added mosque access notice (non-Muslims can't enter). Added Ramadan + Eid + Throne Day notices. Replaced generic holiday mention with specific Moroccan holidays. |
| airlie-beach | 70 | 90 PASS | — | You.com (82%) | 3 weather FAQs, croc warning, tender risk notice.

Recent Rail fixed. | Added 3 weather FAQs (best time, packing, rain). Synced FAQ schema 4→9. Added crocodile warning + tender cancellation risk notice. **Score unchanged** — weather sub-validator still fails because page lacks full static noscript weather section (seasonal guide, at-a-glance, catches, packing, hazards). Needs Yellow Lane weather section build. All 15 factual claims verified TRUE. |
| ajaccio | 54 | 84 PASS | — | You.com (83%) | Removed false tender indicator, Petit Train €12, market hours corrected, FAQ schema synced 6→9, Bastille Day + August closures added, full weather noscript built, 3 weather FAQs added. All noscript fallbacks added. Recent Rail fixed. |
| aitutaki | 66 | 90 PASS | — | You.com (mixed) | Full weather noscript built (tropical oceanic, cyclone zone). Added cyclone season notice (Nov-Apr, critical omission).

Validator fix: weather month checker now accepts N/A for non-applicable activities. |
| akaroa | 64 | 88 PASS | — | You.com (mixed) | Full weather noscript built (temperate maritime, southerly storms). Fixed data-region "Australia"→"New Zealand". Dolphin tour price $150-200→$180-210 NZD. 3 weather FAQs added. FAQ schema synced 4→9. Recent Rail + noscript stories added. |
| akureyri | 56 | 78 PASS | — | You.com (all TRUE) | Fixed data-port-name template artifact. Replaced all generic weather data with subarctic data. Rewrote 5 template FAQs. FAQ schema synced 4→10. Recent Rail + noscript. |

Replaced generic catches-off-guard + packing tips. Updated hazard to subarctic/volcanic. Added Beach/Snorkeling as N/A (required by validator for subarctic port). FAQ schema synced 4→10. Recent Rail + noscript stories added. | **Removed false tender indicator** (most ships dock directly, per You.com + registry). Petit Train 8-10→€12. Market hours corrected (Tue-Sun 7am-1pm, Mon summer only). FAQ schema synced 4→6. Added Bastille Day, August closures, docking note to notices. Needs Yellow Lane weather section build. |

**Fleet-wide blocker:** `recent_articles_validation_failed` — all ports (including cozumel gold standard) lack `#recent-rail-nav-top`, `#recent-rail-nav-bottom`, and article loader script. Needs fleet deployment, not per-port fix.

**Noscript remediation (2026-04-09):** Added noscript fallbacks to all 6 ports:
- Ships Visiting: static ship lists with links (all 6)
- Recent Stories: static article links (all 6)
- Photo Gallery: static image grids (4 ports with galleries)
- Map: text-based location list from "From the Pier" data (all 6)
- Remaining: weather noscript needs Yellow Lane content work on 5 ports
