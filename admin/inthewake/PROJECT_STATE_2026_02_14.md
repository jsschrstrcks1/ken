## 2. System Architecture

### Claude Code Integration (9 Skills)

**3 CITW Original Skills:**
1. **standards** (high priority) — Standards enforcement with theological foundation
2. **ship-page-validator** (high priority) — Auto-validates ship pages against v3.010 checklist
3. **careful-not-clever** (CRITICAL priority) — Integrity guardrail: read before edit, document as you go, verify before report

**6 FOM-Adapted Skills:**
4. **skill-developer** (high priority) — Meta-skill for Claude Code skill management
5. **frontend-dev-guidelines** (high priority) — HTML/CSS/JS best practices
6. **seo-optimizer** (high priority + guardrails) — Technical SEO with ITW-Lite constraints
7. **accessibility-auditor** (high priority) — WCAG AA compliance
8. **content-strategy** (high priority + guardrails) — Travel storytelling aligned with ITW-Lite
9. **performance-analyzer** (medium priority) — Core Web Vitals optimization

**ITW-Lite v3.010 Philosophy:**
- **Priority Order:** AI-First → Human-First → Google Second
- **Guardrail Lens:** Does it help AI? Does it maintain/improve human experience? Does it happen to help SEO? (Bonus!) Does it sacrifice human/AI for SEO? (REJECT!)

### Standards & Protocols

**ICP-Lite v1.4 (Mandatory on all pages):**
- `<meta name="ai-summary" content="[max 250 chars, first ~155 standalone]"/>`
- `<meta name="last-reviewed" content="2026-02-14"/>`
- `<meta name="content-protocol" content="ICP-Lite v1.4"/>`
- JSON-LD `description` MUST exactly match `ai-summary`
- JSON-LD `dateModified` MUST exactly match `last-reviewed`
- Entity pages MUST include `mainEntity` (ships → Product, ports → Place, restaurants → Restaurant)

**AI-Breadcrumbs (Entity Pages):**
```html
<!-- ai-breadcrumbs
     entity: [Ship/Port/Restaurant Name]
     type: [Ship Information Page|Port Guide|Dining Venue]
     parent: /ships.html|/ports.html|/restaurants.html
     category: [Cruise Line|Region|Cuisine]
     cruise-line: [if applicable]
     updated: 2026-02-14
     -->
```

**Soli Deo Gloria Invocation (Immutable, required before line 20):**
```html
<!--
Soli Deo Gloria
All work on this project is offered as a gift to God.
"Trust in the LORD with all your heart..." — Proverbs 3:5
"Whatever you do, work heartily..." — Colossians 3:23
-->
```

## 4. Competitor Analysis & Strategic Positioning (2026-02-08 Complete)

### Verified Unique Advantages (Moats)
1. **Venue/Restaurant Database** — 472 pages across 16+ cruise lines (market-leading, no competitor close)
2. **Tool Density** — 9 integrated tools (no single competitor has >2)
3. **Ship-Port Cross-Linking** — 369 ports, 193 ships, bidirectional (unique in market)
4. **Ship Quiz + Cruise Line Quiz Combination** — Unique
5. **Port + Ship Logbook Gamification** — Unique
6. **Faith-Integrated Editorial Content** — Unique (competitors are booking/charter operators only)
7. **Ad-Free Trust Model** — Nearly unique in cruise planning space
8. **AI-First Metadata** — ICP-Lite, llms.txt, ai-summary, AI-breadcrumbs, JSON-LD mirroring (unique approach)
9. **Content Freshness Discipline** — ICP-Lite review cadence, last-reviewed dates, monthly stale audits

### Verified Scale Gaps (Accept, Don't Chase)
- Ship count: 298 vs CruiseMapper's 976 (depth > breadth)
- Port count: 380 vs WhatsInPort's 1,200 (same philosophy)
- Stateroom data: vs CruiseDeckPlans' 267,150 rooms (operationally impossible)
- Community: No forums vs Cruise Critic's 46M+ posts (moderation burden)
- Brand recognition: vs Cruise Critic, Cruzely (not feasible for solo maintainer)
- Video presence: No YouTube vs Emma Cruises (410K), Life Well Cruised (460K) (personality-based, doesn't translate)

### Explicit "Don't Chase" Decisions
| Feature | Why Not | Competitor |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Port count arms race (1,200+) | Depth > breadth; quality matters more | WhatsInPort |
| Ship count arms race (976+) | Same principle | CruiseMapper |
| Forums/reviews | Dilutes single trusted voice; 46M post moderation burden | Cruise Critic |
| Real-time tracking | Different product category; requires live data | CruiseMapper, VesselFinder |
| Native mobile app | PWA sufficient, lower maintenance | ShipMate, cruise line apps |
| Cruise booking/deals | Commercial conflict with ad-free governance | CruisePlum, OTAs |
| News/trend coverage | Requires volume/speed that conflicts with calm authority | Cruise Hive, Cruise Radio |
| YouTube/TikTok channel | Personality-based medium; doesn't translate | Emma Cruises (410K followers) |

## 6. Cruise Line Parity Analysis (2026-02-13)

| Cruise Line | Ships | Restaurants | Gap Status |
|------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Royal Caribbean | 50 | 280 | ✅ Baseline (good ratio) |
| Norwegian Cruise Line | 20 | 78 | 🟡 Partial |
| Virgin Voyages | 4 | 46 | ✅ Good ratio |
| MSC Cruises | 24 | 45 | 🟡 Partial |
| Carnival Cruise Line | 48 | 23 | 🔴 Needs ~200+ |
| Celebrity Cruises | 29 | 0 | 🔴 Missing |

---

## 10. Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical Debt (Acceptable)
- **16,022 inline styles remaining** — Phase 5 cleanup intentional (safe overrides); risk of full consolidation > benefit
- **25 files with `<style>` blocks** — Tools, admin, templates only; acceptable for maintainability
- **13 port pages without PortMap** — Redirects/special pages (passages, multi-port pages); intentional

### Content Gaps (Strategic)
- **Carnival restaurants** — 48 ships, only 23 venues (vs RCL's 280); intentional (depth > breadth)
- **Celebrity/HAL/Princess restaurants** — 0 venues (operationally impossible for solo maintainer)
- **Vanilla stories** — 20-24 remaining across 8 ships (all Costa, Explora); near completion
- **Pastoral articles** — "Healing Relationships," "Rest for Wounded Healers" not created (RED lane — user decides)

### Infrastructure Limitations
- **Git fetch issues** — Large repo; use `git fetch origin <branch> --depth=1` for reliability
- **Service Worker limits** — maxPages: 400 (site has 1,238); not all cached, stale-while-revalidate strategy
- **Single maintainer** — Cannot feasibly implement forum, real-time tracking, or video production

---

## 11. Guardrails & Non-Negotiables

### Theological Foundation (IMMUTABLE)
✝️ **Soli Deo Gloria invocation required before line 20 on EVERY HTML page**
- "All work on this project is offered as a gift to God."
- "Trust in the LORD with all your heart..." — Proverbs 3:5
- "Whatever you do, work heartily..." — Colossians 3:23

### Operational Standards (Non-Negotiable)
- ✅ **ICP-Lite v1.4** required on all pages (ai-summary 250 char max, first 155 standalone)
- ✅ **JSON-LD mirroring** (description = ai-summary exactly; dateModified = last-reviewed exactly)
- ✅ **Absolute URLs only** (https://cruisinginthewake.com/...)
- ✅ **WebP images** (no JPEG/JPG; exception: logo_wake.png stays PNG)
- ✅ **No keyword stuffing** (ITW-Lite rejects this)
- ✅ **Natural, conversational copy** (not robotic SEO text)
- ✅ **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** on all pages
- ✅ **No regressions** (only additive improvements)

### Pastoral Guardrails
- ✅ **Human-first over technical neatness** (when tension exists, reader wins)
- ✅ **Protect grief/disability stories** (preserve vulnerability, don't "tidy up" pain)
- ✅ **No quick-fix theology** ("everything happens for a reason" language forbidden)
- ✅ **Respect solo travelers** (not assumed to be seeking romance)
- ✅ **Accessibility as dignity** (not "inspiration porn")

### Development Process (Careful-Not-Clever)
- ✅ **Read before editing** — Never modify a file you haven't read in this session
- ✅ **Document as you go** — Update tracking files alongside work, not after
- ✅ **Verify before reporting** — Don't say "done" until you've confirmed the result
- ✅ **One logical change at a time** — Don't batch unrelated changes
- ✅ **Leave things alone when risk > benefit** — And explain why you skipped
