# Ship Pages - Data Files & Images Guide

## Overview
All Royal Caribbean ship pages have been restored to v3.010.300 standard with proper SEO, navigation, and structure. Each page dynamically loads data from JSON files and displays images. This document lists all the expected file locations.

## 🖼️ Images

### 1. **Ship Photos** ("First Look" Carousel)
Each ship page displays 3 carousel images. Lookup paths (in order of fallback):

**Primary paths:**
```
/assets/ships/{ship-slug}1.jpeg
/assets/ships/{ship-slug}2.jpg
/assets/ships/{ship-slug}3.jpg
```

**Fallback paths:**
```
/assets/ships/rcl/{ship-slug}/{ship-slug}1.jpeg
/assets/ships/rcl/{ship-slug}/{ship-slug}2.jpg
/assets/ships/rcl/{ship-slug}/{ship-slug}3.jpg
```

**Example for Radiance of the Seas:**
- `/assets/ships/radiance-of-the-seas1.jpeg` ← Main photo
- `/assets/ships/radiance-of-the-seas2.jpg` ← Secondary photo
- `/assets/ships/radiance-of-the-seas3.jpg` ← Tertiary photo

**All ships require 3 photos each (132 images total)**

---

### 2. **Dining Hero Images** (per ship)
Each ship page displays a dining photo. Lookup paths (in order of fallback):

```
/assets/ships/rcl/{ship-slug}/dining-hero.jpg
/assets/ships/{ship-slug}-dining.jpg
/assets/img/Cordelia_Empress_Food_Court.jpg  ← global fallback
```

**Example:**
- `/assets/ships/rcl/radiance-of-the-seas/dining-hero.jpg`

---

### 3. **Deck Plan Preview**
Currently uses a global placeholder:
```
/assets/ship-map.png
```

This is the same for all ships (can be customized per-ship if needed).

---

### 4. **Global Assets**
Required on all ship pages:
- `/assets/logo_wake.png` - Site logo (already exists)
- `/assets/compass_rose.svg` - Decorative hero element (already exists)
- `/assets/watermark.png` - Background watermark (already exists)

---

## 🔍 Live Ship Tracker

Each ship page has an IMO number specified via `data-imo` attribute. The system uses this to display a live VesselFinder map:

**Example:**
```html
<section data-imo="9195195" data-name="RADIANCE-OF-THE-SEAS">
```

The IMO number automatically loads the ship's current position from VesselFinder.

**Ships with known IMO numbers:**
- adventure-of-the-seas: 9167227
- allure-of-the-seas: 9383936
- anthem-of-the-seas: 9656101
- brilliance-of-the-seas: 9195343
- radiance-of-the-seas: 9195195
- ... (see ship data JSON files for complete list)

**Future ships:** Use `TBD` for ships not yet launched
