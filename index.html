                <p>Ken is a Florida-based follower of King Jesus—a shepherd of both sheep and souls. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies from Trinity College of Florida and is nearing completion of his Master of Divinity at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina.

He delights in traveling to witness firsthand the beauty of God’s creation and in capturing those moments through photography to share with the world. In every sunrise and storm, he sees a glimpse of divine artistry. Ken tends a small flock of actual sheep and pastors a small church in Florida devoted to one simple mission: to take strangers and make them family through the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
